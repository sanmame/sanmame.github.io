Slack regulators are elements that signal the intended degree of precision in the use of an expression to describe a situation. In order to account for this fact, I will adopt Morcycki’s (2011) framework, which allows to directly compare and modify degrees along a scale of imprecision. Under this framework, expressions denote sets of alternatives whose size depends on the degree of precision of the context. \textit{Verdadero} and \textit{auténtico} are argued to be degree modifiers affecting this scale of imprecision by setting the degree of precision of the context to a high value, forcing the modified noun to be interpreted in a strict sense.}

  abstract = {Aspectual modifiers that have adverbial and adjectival counterparts are an important source of information for researching lexical aspect in the nominal domain. One class of such modifiers are adverbs of completeness (\textit{completamente} 'completely', \textit{totalmente} 'totally'), which are maximizers when modify adjectives, and their correspondent adjectives (\textit{completo} 'complete', \textit{total} 'total'). This paper addresses the inheritance of aspectual features and its relation to degree in event nominalizations of incremental theme verbs (\textit{traducción} 'translation', \textit{destrucción} 'destruction') through the analysis of the modification performed by adjectives of completeness in Spanish. The proposal combines a syntactic account of deverbal nominalizations with a scalar approach to aspect. Adjectives of completeness are argued to be aspectual modifiers, with a contribution equivalent to that of their adverbial counterparts both in the verbal and in the adjectival domain, establishing thus a parallelism between degree modification of adjectives, verbs and nominals.}

Spanish adjectives of completeness (\textit{completo} ‘complete’, \textit{total} ‘total’) show a distribution similar to that of their adverbial counterparts when modifying property concept nouns (\textit{libertad} ‘freedom’, \textit{sabiduría} ‘wisdom’). This paper argues that adjectives of completeness are degree modifiers in the nominal domain. It adopts a semantics of property concept nouns according to which they denote substances, following Francez & Koontz-Garboden (2015). These substances can be bounded or unbounded, just like their related adjectives (\textit{libre} ‘free’, etc.). By establishing a strict parallelism between adverbs and adjectives of completeness, this paper contributes to the understanding of completeness contributes to the understanding of scalarity across categories and the relation between degrees and measurements.}

This paper argues that adjectives of completeness are maximality modifiers of \textit{idiot}-like nouns, which are defended to be gradable and denote extreme degrees of properties. Establishing a parallelism between adverbs and adjectives of completeness allows us to explore scalarity across categories and the relevance of scale structure in the nominal domain.}

A degree analysis (Bolinger 1972; Matushansky 2002; Morzycki 2009) encounters some problems, such as the controversial status of nominal gradability and the relation between gradability and value judgment. By focusing on Spanish data, this study shows that the defining element for evaluative nouns is an expressive component of meaning and that these nouns may vary on their gradability and the target of their expressive meaning. Based on this, a typology of evaluative nouns is established. In doing so, this paper contributes to the understanding of evaluativity and the connection between gradability and subjectivity in the nominal domain.}

	abstract = {This paper studies structural convergence between two Romance languages that are in close contact. More specifically, it analyzes the differences in clitic realization and object omission in Spanish and Catalan. While in Spanish it is possible to omit phrases corresponding to direct objects based on their definiteness (Campos, 1986; Clements, 2006) and not to their syntactic position, Catalan does not regularly omit object pronouns but requires the use of the partitive en with indefinite antecedents. A five-point Likert scale grammaticality judgment task adapted from Bruhn de Garavito & Guijarro-Fuentes (2002) was designed to measure the acceptability of different object expressions in 70 different constructions in Spanish by monolingual native speakers (n = 44) and Catalan-Spanish bilingual speakers (n = 34). In the task, participants read a short dialogue containing a question and a short answer and were asked to rate the naturalness of the answer. Linguistic variables included the type of syntactic structure (simple or complex clauses), the semantic properties of the referent (+/- definite), and the grammaticality of the utterance. Stimuli were replicated seven times per condition. Results indicated significant differences between monolinguals and bilinguals, as the latter systematically accept ample optionality concerning null direct objects. Conversely, differences according to language dominance in the bilingual group could not be verified. Our data allow us to discuss views on the realization of interpretable features and on bilingual variability.}
